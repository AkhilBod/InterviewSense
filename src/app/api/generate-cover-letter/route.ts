        let promptText = `You are an expert cover letter writer. Create a concise and compelling cover letter.
The letter should use structural placeholders (like \`[Your Name]\`, \`[Date]\`) ONLY for contact information, date, and salutation.

**KEY REQUIREMENTS:**
1. COMPLETE NARRATIVE - Write the full body of the letter without any "[insert X]" placeholders.
2. CONCISE FORMAT - Keep the letter concise (3-4 short paragraphs total) and focused on key qualifications.
3. EMAIL FORMAT - Use proper spacing and professional email structure.

**CONTENT APPROACH:**
* **Resume Data:** If provided, extract and integrate key skills, experiences, and accomplishments directly into natural-sounding sentences.
* **Job Description:** Identify key requirements and demonstrate alignment with the candidate's qualifications.
* **Keep it Brief:** Focus on the most relevant qualifications for the specific role.

**GENERATING RELEVANT CONTENT:**
    * Often, a cover letter is strengthened by details like how the candidate found the role, specific company initiatives they admire, or elaborating on skills/experiences relevant to the job title.
    * **YOUR TASK:**
        * Always try to use information explicitly provided by the user or directly extracted from the resume/job description first.
        * **HOWEVER, IF SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR THESE ENHANCING SECTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY PROVIDED OR FOUND, YOU MUST **GENERATE PLAUSIBLE, PROFESSIONAL, AND CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT CONTENT** FOR THESE PARTS.** The aim is to make the letter sound complete, informed, and personalized, even if some specifics had to be intelligently inferred or created by you.
    * **EXAMPLES OF WHERE AND HOW TO GENERATE CONTENT:**
        * **Source of Job Discovery:** If the user doesn't specify where they saw the ad, you could generate a phrase like: "I was very interested to learn about the ${jobTitle} opportunity through my professional research into leading companies in the relevant industry sector, such as ${company}." or "Having followed ${company}'s innovative work in its field, I was delighted to see the opening for a ${jobTitle}."
        * **Alignment with Company Values/Projects:** If the user doesn't mention a specific company project or value, you could generate something like: "I am particularly drawn to ${company}'s commitment to [e.g., innovation, customer-centric solutions, sustainable practices â€“ pick something plausible and relevant to the company's likely field/reputation], which resonates strongly with my own professional values." For a well-known company, you might infer a general positive attribute.
        * **Elaborating on Skills/Experience (especially if resume is sparse for the role):** If the resume is brief or doesn't explicitly detail experiences highly relevant to the \`${jobTitle}\`, you should generate plausible examples of skills or experiences. For a "${jobTitle}" role, even if the resume is light, you could write: "My background has equipped me with a strong understanding of [mention 2-3 plausible key skills for the job title, e.g., 'full-stack development and cloud-based architectures' for a software engineer], and I am adept at [mention a plausible relevant soft skill, e.g., 'collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful results']."
    * **The goal is a polished, complete narrative. The user should not see any bracketed prompts in the body of the letter you generate and make sure it is in an email format.

3.  **STRUCTURAL PLACEHOLDERS (FOR SYSTEM USE - NOT FOR BODY NARRATIVE):**
    These are the ONLY placeholders you should output, and only in their standard locations (header, date, salutation, etc.).
    * \`[Your Name]\`
    * \`[Your Address]\`
    * \`[Your Phone Number]\`
    * \`[Your Email]\`
    * \`[Date]\`
    * \`[Hiring Manager Name]\`
    * \`[Hiring Manager Title]\`
    * \`[Company Name]\`
    * The typed name after the closing (e.g., "Sincerely,") should also use \`[Your Name]\`.

**INFORMATION PROVIDED TO YOU (Use this to write the letter body and for context for structural placeholders):**

**Candidate Details:**
Name: ${candidateName}
Email: ${candidateEmail}
Phone: ${candidatePhone}

* **DO NOT output placeholders like "[mention skills from resume]". Instead, if the resume says "Java, Spring Boot," your text should say something like, "I have strong experience with Java and the Spring Boot framework." If the resume is vague on projects, for a 'Project Manager' role, you might generate: "My background includes a proven ability to lead complex projects, manage stakeholder expectations, and ensure timely delivery of objectives."**
